# House_Price_Prediction
This is the first attempt to write python code from me rather a first Linear Regression Model written by a novice ! So it will have a place at least in my personal history :-) 
Armed with some net practise of choosing just 5 features just based on common sense (?), I graduated myself to do a proper feature analysis thereby taking into account half of the features (40 out of 82) in my second atteompt which helped me to reach 82 % accuracy.
Not really satisfied with my tryst, with the help of Chat GPT, this time I did a proper clean up of data, scaling down the outliers & skewed data, finally used correlation to achieve 87% accuracy this time.
Again correlation was applied on numeric data , features based on perception & one-hot encoded features - each of them seperately to pick up the best.
Happy to improve the performance with basic linear regression model without any advanced techniques / improved models.
